# How to Check System Uptime in Windows

Uptime refers to the amount of time a system, server, or device has been continuously running and available without any downtime or interruptions. It is often expressed as a percentage, indicating the reliability of the system over a specific period. For example, if a server has an uptime of 99.9%, it means that the server was operational and available 99.9% of the time during the measured period.

Uptime is a critical metric in IT and server management because it reflects the stability and reliability of a system. High uptime is often a goal for system administrators to ensure that services are consistently available to users or customers.

To check your system uptime in Windows, you can use several methods. Here are a few common ways.

## Using Task Manager

Press `Ctrl` `Shift` `Esc` to open the Task Manager and go to the `Performance` tab. Then select CPU from the left panel, look for the Uptime value near the bottom of the CPU section. This will show the time since the system was last started.
